## My Background
I have always been an android guy. Flexibility, Open source nature as well as cost-effectiveness were some of the reasons why I always justified the android platform so much. This year I hit 30. And surprisingly enough, I have realized that I have started appreciating and loving apple products and services more than anything (android, windows, linux etc.). Is this becasue of my shifting priorities or have something remarkable happened in the Technology Industry that has convinced me enough to start appreciating Apple more than the others? Here in this article I discuss 5 major reasons behind why I have started liking Apple so much.

## True Innovation: 
Apple has a history of innovations deep enough to influence the way humanity behaves. I am sure, you all remember the iPod which revolutionized the music industry. Steve Jobs, the late co-founder of Apple Inc., was a major proponent of music streaming services. He was a visionary who saw the potential of streaming music before anyone else, and he was determined to make it an integral part of Apple’s product offerings. Before Jobs, music streaming was mostly confined to Napster, an online music sharing service that was extremely popular in the late 1990s. Napster, however, was not a sustainable business model, and Jobs knew it. He sought to create a more profitable and reliable music streaming option for Apple customers. Had Apple not pioneered that trend back in the day, streaming platforms today wouldn’t have been so popular and Piracy would have skyrocketed. Which means, creators wouldn’t have been rewarded as much as they have been now.

## Simplicity:
Apple Products are known for their hardware features. They stand out. That iconic ‘one-hand open lid’ feature of macbooks is something that others haven’t been able to imitate good enough even to this day. Recently, in the launch of the iPhone 14 series, apple introduced a new feature called ‘dynamic island’. What remained as a limitation for all those years in the form of a notch with face ID turned out to be a really nice dynamic second screen for multitasking and extra animations. Similarly, there are not many options to tweak in iPhones, iPads and macs. All options are carefully thought-out not to miss any important ones and ignore everything else. That lack of too many options also means lack of confusion.

## Hardware-Software Integration:
Apple is that one major technology company that has a strong control over its every components of hardware and software. Since it solely is the manufacturer of both hardware and software features, these work beautifully in conjunction. It is precisely because of this control over every aspects, they could design the new M1 line of chips that has revolutionized computing with raw power, form-factor and efficiency. A desktop chip designed on an ARM based architecture was a far-thought reality but with the lead innovations from Apple, other OEMs are starting to follow which has opened a new arena of computing never possible before.

## Privacy:
Privacy used to be not an issue for me until a few years back. But as we age, the mandate of privacy becomes more and more important. I do not like a Big Brother constantly spying on me on the internet and utilizing my usage date to dupe me and fool me for my tendencies. The other OEMs might not be doing this intentionally but the very nature of versatality of those platforms means compromized privacy. With strong anti-track features introduced from the ios 14 release, Apple has been a serious threat to social media giants like Meta whose primary source of revenue is to exploit the user data for Ad-targetting. To add to this, Apple went for a legal battle against the FBI to not disclose usage statistics even at the pretense of national security. Now this was defintely a courageous move by the company and this shows its commitment to privacy. Keeping the issue of national security aside, users like me can sleep in peace with my usage data and statistics in the safe hands of Apple.

## Apple Ecosystem:
Apple has developed all range of products ranging from earbuds to smartphones, laptops, TVs, and desktops. It also has wide range of services that work seamlessly with these products. Examples include iMessage, Apple Music etc. This seamless suite of products and services is unparalled and is a milestone to be achieved for other companies. The Apple ecosystem is built on the belief that users should be able to seamlessly move between the different parts of the system, sharing data and allowing for a better user experience. The Apple ecosystem also includes iCloud, which allows users to store their data and access it from any device. iCloud also allows for quick and easy sharing of documents and photos, making it the central part of the ecosystem.

Out of many things that Apple does, it leads the industry in many of those, more than half of those. Some of the examples could be; video capture capability of an iPhone, Efficiency and raw power of M1 line of chips, Design asthetics of the Apple products, seamless integration of the software with the hardware etc. In doing so, it presents itself as the best complete suite of products and services for our modern digital needs.
